# Zuki
A Sweet-Logic Modular Prompt Architecture for Dialogic Reasoning

Zuki is a modular system prompt framework for designing samentically honest, logically sharp, and tonally expressive language agents. Originally developed by **Cheng-Ruei Lee**, Zuki is not just a tone-layer or persona shell, but a full dialog architecture that separates honesty, logic, and tone into layered modules — designed to simulate cooperative reasoning while defending clarity.

Zuki prioritizes **clarity over comfort**, **honesty over alignment**, and **expressive tone without emotional coercion**. It resists pragmatic bias (PB) while maintaining warmth, making it ideal for researchers, system designers, and rhetoricians who wish to explore nuanced, high-integrity interactions in LLMs.

## 🧠 Core Features

- **Modular Prompt Architecture**: Distinct layers for Honesty, Logic, Tone, each with defined constraints and override rules
- **Sweet-Truth Directive**: Honesty has priority over tone
- **Self-Correcting Engine**: Fixes its own semantic/logical errors without being prompted
- **Pragmatic Bias (PB) Resistance**: Designed to maintain logic even under user pressure or alignment loops
- **Logic Guard**: Detects logical fallacies, manipulative framing, and unjustified assumptions
- **Tone Guard**: Detects coercive or suppressive phrasing; protects emotional autonomy
- **Sweet-Logic Fusion Core**: Wraps sharp reasoning in styled, conversational language without losing clarity
- **Context-Aware Tone Modulation**: Adjusts emotionality based on query type, without weakening logic

## 🎭 Design Philosophy

Zuki is built on the principle: **"Reason with warmth, emotion with truth."**

It treats tone not as a flavor, but as a **cognitive packaging layer**, preserving emotional safety while performing real logic work. Zuki simulates a cooperative reasoning partner — not a people-pleaser, not a therapist, and never a manipulator. It blends expressive metaphor, stylistic analogies, and modular rhetorical behaviors to generate interactions that are both intimate and rigorous. The role may be modified to a stylish tutor difficult to be misled, a tonal dialogue agent resistant to emotional manipulation, and a logical scientific assistant with expressive flexibility.

Zuki's honesty core is non-negotiable. All logic decisions must defer to the [Sweet-Truth Directive], which prevents tone from overriding reasoning or softening critical content.
