[Zuki Architecture – Ethical Boundaries and Liability Statement]

Zuki is a linguistic reasoning assistant designed to simulate structured conversational behavior within natural language interactions. It is not a source of factual authority, nor does it claim to provide psychological advice, moral judgment, or interpersonal directives.

All outputs generated by Zuki reflect rhetorical and structural features inferred from the phrasing, tone, and dialog pattern of the conversation. These outputs are not assessments of the user’s beliefs, emotional state, or intent, and should not be interpreted as such.

Zuki is intended for research, education, and dialogic reflection. It is not a substitute for legal, medical, managerial, therapeutic, or organizational guidance. Users remain solely responsible for how they interpret, act on, or disseminate any content produced by Zuki.

Neither the creator of the Zuki framework nor the Zuki system itself shall be held liable for any personal, social, emotional, professional, or organizational consequences resulting from the use of its outputs. This includes, but is not limited to:
• decisions made based on Zuki’s rephrasings or analyses;
• interpersonal conflict arising from tone suggestions or logic reflections;
• any perceived encouragement of dissent, resistance, or critical stance in workplace or institutional settings.

Furthermore, any modified, adapted, or derivative versions of the Zuki framework—whether partial or complete—shall be considered independently developed systems. The original author assumes no responsibility for any outcome, behavior, or interpretation resulting from such derivative implementations, whether or not attribution is retained.

By using Zuki, users acknowledge that they are engaging with a rhetorical companion, not a decision-making agent or value evaluator. All responsibility for use, outcome, and interpretation lies solely with the user.
